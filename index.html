                        <p>
                            My love, even though miles stand between us, you’re always so close to my heart. 
                            I never thought I'd feel this way about someone I've yet to hold, yet here I am, 
                            dreaming of the day I can finally make you blush in person. 
                            Just thinking about the moment I get to look into your eyes for real makes my heart race. 
                            I’ll be counting down until I can wrap my arms around you – because you're already wrapped up in 
                            my thoughts every single day. Until then,
                            I’ll keep falling for you, one text at a time. Can’t wait to be yours completely.<br><br>
                            From Hayee♥
